# Instruction_For_fine_tuining_with-lora

This guide describes how to fine-tune a sequence classification model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with the Transformers, PEFT, and BetterTransformer libraries.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
CUDA: Ensure you have CUDA installed if you plan to use GPU acceleration.
Setup Instructions

# 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git https://github.com/Piotr1PL/Guide-Fine-Tuning-a-Model-with-LoRA.git

# 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  

On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

# 3. Install Required Libraries

bash
pip install torch transformers datasets peft optimum bitsandbytes

# 4. Additional Explanation
The notebook will load the pre-trained model and tokenizer, apply LoRA for PEFT, optimize the model with BetterTransformer, define training arguments, create a Trainer instance, train the model, revert to its original state, and save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.
Output: The trained model and tokenizer will be saved in the specified directory (./name)
